      <h3>üîÑ How It Works</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Upload</b> any file up to 250MB via our clean, one-click interface.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Receive a secure ID -</b> a unique alphanumeric code that serves as
          your download key.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Share the ID</b> with your intended recipient via email, messaging
          app, or however you prefer.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>One-time download -</b> As soon as the file is downloaded, it's
          permanently deleted.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Auto-expiry -</b> If untouched, the file still deletes itself after
          7 days, no questions asked.
        </li>
      </ol>
